1- How Much is True? => Create a function which returns the number of true values there are in an array.
NOTE:
-Return 0 if given an empty array.
-All array items are of the type boolean (true or false).

2- Find and sum even number from an array => Create a function that takes an array as parameter and prints out the even number in the array and their summition.

3- A word is on the loose and now has tried to hide amongst a crowd of tall letters! Help write a function to detect what the word is, knowing the following rules:

- The wanted word is in lowercase.
- The crowd of letters is all in uppercase.
- Note that the word will be spread out amongst the random letters, but their letters remain in the same order.
Hint ==> the input string will be something like this "SDNIDWDWDNDwordKJNJSDN".

4- Eligiblity for a discount => the "checkDiscountEligibility" function takes a person object with a name and age. The function uses an if condition to check if the person's age is between 18 and 30 (inclusive). If the condition is true, it prints a message indicating that the person is eligible for a discount; otherwise, it prints a message saying the person is not eligible.

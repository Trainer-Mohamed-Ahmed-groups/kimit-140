4- consider a scenario where you have a list of employees, and you want to create a formatted string that includes their names and job titles. We'll use map to transform the array of objects, slice to limit the number of employees displayed, and join to create a formatted string.

in this task you will have to print the original array of object, the selected employees array of object (like first two or three object in the array of object) and the formatted string composed from the name of the employee and the job title like (Alice - Software Engineer etc..).

const employees = [
  { name: 'Alice', jobTitle: 'Software Engineer' },
  { name: 'Bob', jobTitle: 'Data Scientist' },
  { name: 'Charlie', jobTitle: 'Product Manager' },
  { name: 'David', jobTitle: 'UX Designer' },
  { name: 'Eva', jobTitle: 'Marketing Specialist' },

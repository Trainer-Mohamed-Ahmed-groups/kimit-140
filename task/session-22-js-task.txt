1- Your task is to create a function called transformObject that takes the person object as an argument and transforms it into a new object with the following properties:

fullName: a string combining the person's name and age. (e.g., "John 30")
jobLocation: a string combining the person's job and city. (e.g., "Developer in Example City")

Your function should return the transformed object.

initial object example:
var person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  job: "Developer",
  city: "Example City"
};

2- Your task is to create a function called filterPeople that takes the people array as an argument and returns a new array containing only the people who are 30 years old or older.

initial array of objects:
var people = [
  { name: "John", age: 30 },
  { name: "Alice", age: 25 },
  { name: "Bob", age: 35 },
  { name: "Eve", age: 28 }
];

3- Your task is to create a function called calculateAverageGrades that takes the students array as an argument and transforms it into a new array with the following properties:

studentAverages: an array of objects where each key is a student's name, and the value is their average grade.

Your function should return the transformed array array of objects.
Hint ==> the new array of objects will contain objects like this for example: {name: "Alice", average: 80%}

initial array of objects:
var students = [
  { name: "Alice", grades: [90, 85, 88] },
  { name: "Bob", grades: [78, 92, 87] },
  { name: "Charlie", grades: [95, 89, 78] },
  { name: "David", grades: [88, 90, 92] }
];

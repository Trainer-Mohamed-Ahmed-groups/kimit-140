1- A word is on the loose and now has tried to hide amongst a crowd of tall letters! Help write a function to detect what the word is, knowing the following rules:

- The wanted word is in lowercase.
- The crowd of letters is all in uppercase.
- Note that the word will be spread out amongst the random letters, but their letters remain in the same order.
Hint ==> the input string will be something like this "SDNIDWDWDNDwordKJNJSDN".

2- let object = {
    name: "ahmed",
    age: "55",
    city: ["Egypt", "Alexandria"],
    married: true,
    sons: [
            {name: "mohamed", age: 30},
            {name: "ashraf", age: 20},
            {name: "mai", age: 15}
        ],
}

- you have this object, create a function for a movie theater ticket box that takes this object as a parameter and checks if the father is not married he will enter the movie and pay the total price of one ticket, but if he is married but does not have children he will buy two tickets, in case that he is married and have children he will buy 5 tickets but if the age of the person is more than 25 no discount will be applied, if the age of the person is less than 25 and more than 16 a discount of 10% will be applied, and if the age of the person is less than 16 a discount of 25% will be applied. all i want from you to be displayed at the end is the price of the ticket like this
OUTPUT: (number of ticket bought) tickets and the total price is (total price).

----NOTE----
ticket price = 100$
